        AoEPulse is an Age of Empires 2 statistics website which parses and stores millions of replays to give never before seen insights on the effectiveness of the different core openings. The data is updated twice daily at 3:00 and 15:00 GMT. This site is primarily focused on 1v1 Arabia (due to it being the only map and mode with enough games to draw meaningful conclusions) but also provides any stats collected for all other maps and Empire Wars where possible. Openings may not be as accurate on these other maps or modes (specifically the different timings of Empire Wars and the uniqueness of nomad don`&apos;`t agree with the heuristics.) I hope these statistics help provide the insights you need to take your game to the next level!

      <h2>Update (September 20, 2022)</h2>
      <p>
        Created a dump of the entire database with over 5 million matches for anyone who wants to play with the backbone of AoEPulse themselves. See this reddit post for more information.

      <h2>Update (May 26, 2022)</h2>
      <p>
        We began reaching storage capacity limits (
        {'>'}
        22gb postgres database) 90%+ all used by the average tech timings tab. This seems to be a mostly useless and unused tab so it was removed. This allows us to store match data for longer and also reduces the cost to keep the website online substantially! I want to someday do something more with that data but what was implemented just wasn`&apos;`t a good use.

      <h2>Update (May 6, 2022)</h2>
      <p>
        The big release of the Advanced Query interface! Now you can query far more specific matchups as well look up personal stats with your aoe2.net profile id. This id can be found as the trailing numbers on your aoe2.net profile page. For example, Vinchesters`&apos;`s profile link is
        {' '}
        <a href="https://aoe2.net/#profile-271202">https://aoe2.net/#profile-271202</a>
        {' '}
        and therefore his profile id is 271202. Every completed response in the advanced query interface will create a unique link that can be copied and referenced at any point in the future to see that same data again. This has been a huge project and I am thrilled that it is finally ready to go public! Also, we have finally passed 3 million parsed replays! So much data!

      <h2>Update (Jan 5, 2022)</h2>
      <p>
        Added Straight FC and Unknown openings types to better represent the playerbase (not shown in graph). Openings matchup mirrors were also only half counted in play rate so this has been fixed. You may see a few percent changes in the above graph and on the Opening Stats page. Also added a small about page.

        Another large set of work to move the data from sqlite3 to postgres. Worlds faster and requests are no longer blocking so the site should feel a whole lot more responsive as a whole. Also added endpoints and infrastructure to update matches remotely, so now I can hide that behind a cron job rather than updating data every... few months by hand. Cheers!
      </p>
      <h2>Update (Nov 26, 2021)</h2>
      <p>
        Big rewrite of the database to improve scaling and responsiveness with up to 200x speedups for some of the biggest queries! I never expected to have
        {' '}
        {'>'}
        1M replays analyzed when I started this project. Next big project is adding an endpoint and infrastructure to automatically update the website as I download and parse new replays.
      </p>
      <h2>Alpha release (Oct 5, 2021)</h2>
      <p>
        Initial release with 1 patch worth of data and 400k replays! Some queries take forever but the site all works at least.
